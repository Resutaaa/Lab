    <p class = "intro1 fade-in-text"> I have a background on HTML and CSS when I was in junior high school. Now in first year college, my knowledge about HTML and CSS expanded and I learned how to design a website. I can say that my experience in learning HTML and CSS here in college is more fun compare to junior high school because only the basics are taught way back then. </p>
     
    <p class = "skills fade-in-text"> C++ </p>
    <p class = "intro1 fade-in-text"> Here in my freshman year, I learned the concept of programming. It is hard for me in my first weeks because I don't have any knowledge about it. But as the time goes on, I enjoyed it a lot and I learned many syntax and the correct structure of coding. As of now, I can perform loops,  make a basic calculator and a basic computer of grade. </p>
